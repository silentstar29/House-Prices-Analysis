This is our Project deployed on Heroku app: :<a href="https://house-prices-analysis.herokuapp.com/"</a>

Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this project aims to predict the final price of each home.

Project built using Flask, D3.js, Ploty.js, Bootstrap and machine learning libraries sklearn, xgboost, lightgbm & vecstack.

This project is proudly brought to you by: Ryan Abnavi, David Centa, Aygul Matyakubova and Jose Lujan
